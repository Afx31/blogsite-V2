## Car Blogsite

I've created this Blogsite from scratch to host the build threads of my cars which have been previously posted on forums. "Ahh, the good ol days of forums"..

With the decline of forum activity due to social media, they are slowly being decomissioned and sometimes users aren't informed, and their data is lost. This will allow me to keep record of every post myself, as I've copied/pasted & rewrote all the posts into markdown files, which are then rendered here. I'll keep various backups of the markdown files so they'll never be lost.

This also allows me to have all the cars in 1 central location, easy to pass around to anyone and read in the nice format.

#### Some tech info

I originally wrote this using the MERN stack during uni, however after putting it on the backburner for a year or two, new technology has come out, so I created a new repo (being this one) and rewrote the whole thing in NextJs, to utilise tech such as Vercel, Prisma, PlanetScale etc.. Very smooth and easy to build and deploy.

In the future I'll make small enhancements to make this look better, optisimised to load faster etc. In v1 I had a whole user auth and comments system, scrapped for initial MVP on this project, I'll look to bring back eventually.

If you find any issues with the site or have issues, feel free to raise a repo Issues.

Thank you!
