Next step was to install the headunit that came out of my civic. The previous owner removed the headunit, not sure why but he said he enjoyed the sound of VTEC? I'd still leave a headunit in but oh well, maybe previous one didn't work? All I know is, I still enjoy some tunes when cruising around. Used the headunit plug loom from my civic which I did cut out, as the car is only really seeing the track now I'll tape it back behind the dash on that car.

Lucky nothing sparked/arked from these flying around with the positive and negatives wires free.

Along with this I noticed the cigarette lighter plug thingy was faded, luckily I had a spare. I had a replica Personal Box sticker on the ash tray in my civic, thought it would look better in the EF9. Maybe one day I'll but an actual one. When removing the center console I noticed the ash tray has a light running to it, and at night confirmed it worked along with the cigarette lighter ring around it as well. Pretty cool!

Interior looking much better! The steering wheel that came with the car was some rep, horrible thing it was bending and making driving with no PS even worse! I do plan to buy a steering wheel for this car, but for now I'll just use the steering wheel off my civic as it only needs a steering wheel for the track which can easily be swapped back, and more cost effective at the moment. Definitely helped with the driving feel.

Pretty happy with how the interior now looks with a few minor fixes:

Last up was fixing the passenger parker light, it always stuck out on a weird angle, was told the guard is bent or something. Upon investigating it was just missing the black clips to go behind. As I've said and will say more throughout this resto, luckily I had spares..
