# The EF9 Intro

Well well well, look whose bought another car.. Since owning my first ED Civic which is now more so my "track car" I've always dreamt of owning a genuine EF9 street car one day, where I could throw my old Work Equip 01's on and essentially be like my civic before the roll cage went in. However with prices of JDM cars sky rocketing and EF9's that are starting to be imported being north of 20k (and still needing work done to them) the dream slowly started to fade away..

About a month ago a friend who bought a EF9 last year contacted me asking how much do I think his is worth, and from that started a 3hr chat that evening about his EF9 which lead into me seeing it in person and test driving, which lead to me now being the owner of a complete genuine EF9! I did get it for a lot less than the imported ones I mentioned above however it does need a fair bit of TLC, the car originally had black Mugen MR5's on but 1: they were weak specs; 2: I don't really like the MR5's, more of a CF-48 kinda guy (letting him keep them reduced the price a decent amount as well). At some point in it's life time it's had a open door respray from the original grey to white, I do like white however I believe the end goal will be respraying it to the grey. It will be a long term OEM restoration project, de-modifying a few areas on the car and adding my own personal touches with some other modifications, along with some Honda Access parts I have stored away.

I don't expect this build to be resprayed and completed by the end of the year, for a while it'll be just fixing any mechanical issues and enjoying the car as is, still need to fix the ride height from previous ownership which will be done soon. Stay tuned for more to come!
