So sometime last week I tackled quite a few things which I wanted to either fix or cleanup asap. First thing was the interior lights/cig lighter/clock were not working, previous owner said he had a cig lighter fan he used for a while and then one day it stopped working. As assumed it took out a fuse or two so quickly replaced them. Was good fun as the fuse box diagram was all in Japanese, of course nothing Google translate couldn't solve

The boot gas struts wern't holding the boot lid up. Previous owner apparently couldn't find any, luckily I had some spares. Another thing that made me chuckle a little was the battery tie down was upside down, *sigh*.. It's not really in the best condition, the black plastic is all falling off and it's rusty underneath. These can still be bought brand new I've been told so that will happen in the future. Also need to fix up the terminals/wiring somewhen, tad sketchy..

One thing I forgot to include with the first post was the brand new hardrace front/rear camber arms that came with the car. I put the rears in to fit my Work Equips under the guards without rolling them. I plan to raise the rear with a slight roll so I can pull some camber out of the rear. Also the Tein coilovers that came in the car have seen better days but will do for a while until I buy new suspension (might be a while).
