Howdy! So I've been in the old school Honda game for over 3yrs now with my track/street built hatch (https://honda-tech.com/forums/honda-...chbox-3251019/) and I've now picked up a new project, a RT4WD Wagon! 

Plans with this some what barn find which has been off the road for 9 years is to restore it, make it look shmick, and slap a SOHC VTEC motor in it and turbo! I've always wanted to do a SOHC Turbo build, and which chassis would be better than a 4WD wagon hehe. Here's some starting photos for the old girl, bit rusty around the window but apart from that the rest of the chassis is somewhat clean!
