# Rusty roof.. What have I bought
22/02/2018

Sooooo... I felt like removing the plastic seat trim pieces on the side of the roof to see what lies below, and boy did I find some rust.. In the first photo below you'll see where I marked boxes with a permo, inside those sections is where rust is. The one on the left I then provided a photo of before I poked around and then after with a torch shinning through from inside. This weekend I plan to drop the sunroof assembly and cut out all the rust, and weld in my sheet metal to sort that section. Not worried about looks as it'll be covered, just as long as the rust is gone and it's sealed!

Also, the previous owner had the roof rack holes filled in, he wasn't sure how the shop did it. I was praying they did it the easy way and used bog, but nope, they welded it and did a pretty peasant job of it. No paint or anything to prevent future rust and here we go people, 3 sets of bolt holes either side of the roof all nice and rusty... sigh

Few days later, I started sussing the rust on the roof today first with dropping the sunroof. Quite easy to drop it actually. 3 12mm either side and 2 on the front and out she came. Once it was removed hopes got a litter hurt. So on the drivers edge of the roof the rust was fairly bad, not sure how it all started but yeh where the roof skin meets the chassis was completely rusted there, quite badly. Ooooh'd and ummmm'd and decided the best thing to do is to drill the roof out, cut all the rust out and weld new pieces of metal in. So in the next few coming weeks I shall do so. But here are some photos from today showing the sections of the rust. Also cleaned up the sunroof and also the head liner. Good thing is the sunroof assembly itself isn't actually rusted at all apart for the left rear corner which has a little bit of surface rust. Shame the OEM bronze tinted glass is cracked :/
