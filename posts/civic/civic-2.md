# First week of ownership 'mods'
## Interior swap + muffler delete week 1/2 of ownership
28/10/2014

Within the first week of owning her, I've bought a whole grey/black interior from someone who was parting out an entire B18C7 ED after it had a recent accident. My interior is the factory blue which was very clean, no scratches, tears or marks anywhere, but I simply didn't like it. The grey/black was always the ideal coloured interior to get.

I managed to fit the entire interior (minus front seats as the owner had different aftermarket seats) into the back of my Civic, including the dash.. Quite the ute!

I got right to it with swapping over the interior. I've never pulled apart an interior to this extent in the past so it was going to be fun.. Luckily being a much older car, it seems like items like the dash were barely held in. Mainly a bolt either side left/right, then one top/bottom.

My first time experiencing rust on a car, was quite scared (as I'm editing this in the future in 2022, it's funny to think how scared I was seeing the rust, to now think with everything I've done across all my cars, I'd be scared if there wasn't rust! :P)

Grey/black interior nearly all back together. Didn't seem to take any photos once it was completed, but everything went back together as intended and I was quite chuffed!

I also did a custom muffler delete because back in the days I loved making noise with a loud exhaust, still do but starting to prefer induction > exhaust!

Within the 2nd week of owning it, I decided to do something about the quiet exhaust. A friend who worked as a diesel mechanic found the rear exhaust section from a Hilux in the bin at his work, which would be perfect for the muffler delete angled exhaust I wanted to do. I had learnt welding in high school (was doing my final HSC exams at the time) on a MIG gas welder, however I had access to a friends MIG gasless welder. Not the best welds, quite lumpy as you'd imagine but at the time I was happy with it.

Welded a flange on with the thought in mind to flange the original muffler (never happened). Boi was it loud, popping everywhere due to the carbs. It was awesome! I'll have to upload a old clip of it to upload and embed here.

** Reminder!
