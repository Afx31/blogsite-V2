Howdy! I'm Will from Australia, owner of a 1989 Honda Civic ED6. I purchased the car on the evening of 13th October 2014 as a daily but to also get me into some track activities. I had view the car the weekend before with my two mates whom are mechanics to check over the vehicle, she was a beauty!

I've created this build thread to record the progression of the car over the rest of it's life, to document any RnD I carry out and to use it as material I can show people whom are interested in the build, yet also to refer back to myself if needed to in the future.

Heres how she looked the morning after picking her up (in between my 2 days of HCS English exams :) )
