About 1 month later I went ahead with purchasing some suspension mods, some of which were new to me. This purchase consisted of GAB SS coilovers, Skunk2 front & rear camber arms and a red Civic rear garnish piece.

I'm still learning my way around working on a car, with my previous Mazda SP20 I didn't require camber arms when lowering it. I purchased this from the same car I bought the grey interior from. The car was moved from the previous location to somewhere near mine, and the owner was busy with work so told me to just go over and remove the bits myself, and leave the cash somewhere safe.

Off I went with my entry level 3/8 socket set I had, no idea what I had to remove but the owner assisted over messenger with instructions on how to remove things, and some googling on my behalf. It took a while to remove everything myself and taking note of where things went for when I went to install on mine. But heres the results of the haul!

The next day I went to install the suspension I was quite stumped on how the bottom bolt hole for the rear coilover was supposed to line up with the lower control arm on my Civic. After asking the guy I bought them from I learnt there are 2 style of rear lower control arms in our Honda's, which changes the bottom design of the coilover, those 2 styles being "eyelet" and "fork". My Civic was originally fork, but the coilovers were eyelet as the previous owner bought EF9 lower control arms.

Luckily with him being super nice, he said just to pop back over to the car at his and remove the lower control arms from it, I can't remember if I paid for them or not. I remember it was hot again, I was filthy and darting around with the unknown of what I've gotten myself into. In the end I got it all sorted!

There is many talks about which is better, and "apparently" the eyelet is a better design for specific engineering reasons I don't know.
